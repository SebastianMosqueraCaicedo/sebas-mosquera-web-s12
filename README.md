# Database test
Html, css and js integration with a database framework (PocketBase in this case) in order to create a functioning login and sign up feature.

## Dependencies
The prebuilt [minimal PocketBase app (0.7.9)](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) is placed in the root directory and run with ./pocketbase serve.

In order to enter the admin environment, go [here](http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/). If it is the first time using pocketbase, it will ask you to sign up. Current admin is test@test.com, password: 1234567890
